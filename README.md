# Mangement system of Parking
  In this project we would like to simulate a management system for parking of the university.
## Technology
  I used Verilog Hardware design language and Quartus to Sysntesize the circuit for an fpga and to get maximum frequency. 
## Implementation Details
  I use Verilog HDL to make two modules, Counter Module to simulate spending time, and the main module (Parking) that is the main system of parking managering.
## How to run
You can use icarus to run verilog code 
first run "iverilog -o Parking_TB Parking_TB.v" command, and then run "vvp Parking_TB" to simulate Parking_TB module and see results of simulation of the above moduls and the vcd file.
Also you can use Modelsim.
## Results 
After running above commands you can see performance of the cicruit by the prepared vcd file and the printed results.
You can refer to doc folder to see explanation of the project and refer to code folder to see code of the project. Also i prepared the output of the simulation and also the vcd file and uploded in the doc file.

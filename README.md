# Mangement system of Parking
  In this project we would like to simulate a management system for parking of the university.
## Technology
  I used Verilog Hardware design language and Quartus to Sysntesize the circuit for an fpga and to get maximum frequency. 
## Implementation Details
  I use Verilog HDL to make two modules, Counter Module to simulate spending time, and the main module (Parking) that is the main system of parking managering.
## How to run
You can use icarus to run verilog code 
first run "iverilog -o Parking_TB Parking_TB.v" command, and then run "vvp Parking_TB" to simulate Parking_TB module and see results of simulation of the above moduls.
## Results 
After running above commands you can see performance of the cicruit.
